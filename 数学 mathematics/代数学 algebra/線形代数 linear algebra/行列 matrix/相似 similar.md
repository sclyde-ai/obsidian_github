$$ B = P^{-1} A P, \exists P $$
A and B are similar
- equivalence relation
    - reflexivity
        $$ A \sim A $$
    - symmetry
        $$ A \sim B \Leftrightarrow B \sim A $$
    - transivity
        $$ A \sim B \land B \sim C \Rightarrow A \sim C $$
        - proof
            $$ B = P^{-1} A P, C = P^{-1}B P \\ \Rightarrow C = P^{-1} P^{-1}B PP
            $$
            P is regular, then PP & P^-1 P^-1 are regular
- theorem
    - determinant is equivalent
    - rank is equivalent
    - trace is equivalent
    - eigenvalue is equivalent
    - factorial is similar
