        overnight (above 70)
            A high RSI (above 70) suggests that a stock's price has risen too quickly and may be due for a correction or pullback.
            When RSI rises above 70 and then crosses back below it, it can signal a potential selling opportunity.
        mid-range (between 30 and 70)
            The RSI is generally neutral when in this range, suggesting that the price movement is neither overbought nor oversold
        oversold (below 30)
            A low RSI (below 30) suggests that a stock's price has fallen too quickly and may be due for a rebound.
            When RSI falls below 30 and then crosses back above it, it can signal a potential buying opportunity.
