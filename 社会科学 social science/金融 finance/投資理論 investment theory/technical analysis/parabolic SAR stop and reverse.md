$$
SAR_{n+1} = SAR_n + AF(EP - SAR_n)
$$
- EP extreme point
    representing the highest price in an uptrend or the lowest price in a downtrend
- AF acceleration factor
    which starts at a default value (usually 0.02) and increases incrementally (usually by 0.02) when a new extreme price point (EP) is reached, up to a maximum (often 0.2)
