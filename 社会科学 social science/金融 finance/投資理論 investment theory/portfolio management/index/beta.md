the sensitivity 
of the return of an asset 
to the return of the market portfolio
$$
\beta_i = \frac{\sigma_{iM}}{\sigma^2_M} = \frac{Cov(R_i, R_M)}{Var(R_M)}
$$
$\beta > 1$ : aggressive, high volatility
$\beta = 1$ : the same to market
$0 <\beta < 1$ : defensive, low volatility 
$\beta = 0$ : indifferent to market
